        I embarked on my programming journey in early 2023, starting from
        scratch. Initially focusing on backend development, I delved into the
        intricacies of the Go programming language. Subsequently, I expanded my
        skill set to encompass frontend technologies, refining my proficiency in
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This comprehensive approach has equipped me
        with a well-rounded understanding of both backend and frontend
        development, enabling me to approach projects with a holistic
        perspective.
